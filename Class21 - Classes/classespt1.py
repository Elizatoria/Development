# Test equality between this object and another, return a boolean.

# Accessor method


# Create a point object with attributes x=2, y=3

# Letâ€™s add a __str__ method to our Point2D class so we can print Point2D objects.


# Lets add __add__ to add objects of the same class together


# Lets try __sub__ to add objects of the same class together

# Let's try __eq__ method to test equality
'''What is the output of this code if we don't override ==?
What is the output if we override == to use value equality?
Is it the same or different? Why?

Without the __eq__ method, we will only be able to test if it is the same object
'''



# Let's try __lt__ method to test less than


# Setting with mutator methods



# Getting with accessor methods
