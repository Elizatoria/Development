'''
1. Create a python file called name_module.py. 
2. Inside this python file, you will create 3 functions. 
3. One called full_name, another called reverse_name, and a third called get_initials. 
4. Each function will take 2 strings. 
5. One string will be the first name, the second string will be the last name. 
6. full_name will concatenate and return the full name. 
For example if the first string is "Joseph" and the second string is "Simpson" This function will return the string, "Joseph Simpson". 
Reverse name will flip the name around. 
The name Diana Prince, would come back as Prince Diana. 
The third function will take the first and last name and return the initials. 
The name Tony Stark will return T.S.'''
