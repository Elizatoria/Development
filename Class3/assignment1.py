# Formula for the Perimeter of a Triangle
# Perimeter = Side1 + Base + Side2

side1 = 5  # Side # 1
base = 6  # Base
side2 = 10  # Side # 2

perimeter = side1 + base + side2  # Perimeter of a Triangle Calculation

print('The Perimeter of your Triangle is', perimeter)  # Printing out the Perimeter

print('Is Side # 1 greater than Side # 2?', side1 > side2)  # Printing out if Side # 1 is greater than Side # 2

print('Is the Base equal to Side # 1?', base == side1)  # Printing out if the Base is equal to Side # 1
